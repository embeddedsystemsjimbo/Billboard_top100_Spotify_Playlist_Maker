# Billboard_top100_Spotify_Playlist_Maker


Using the Beautiful Soup API, the Billboard website (https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/) is scraped to determine the top 100 songs for a given date. 

Using the song information, a customize Spotify playlist is created and link provided in console using the Spotipy API. If a song is not available on the Spotify, the unavailable song and associated artist is printed to console (See Figure 1).
